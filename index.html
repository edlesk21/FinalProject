            <p>Hi! My name is Edward Leskauskas (but I go by E.J.) and I am currently at senior at Michigan State University. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Science, with a focus in Human-Centered Technology. </p>
            <p>Originally from New Jersey, I came to MSU to expand my horizons and explore what Michigan offers. Coming to college, I planned on studying Political Science and going to law school, but I found that I had a passion for technology. As a current Information Science student, the main focus of my studies has been in cybersecurity and cloud computing.</p>

        <p> Over the last two summers, I have been an intern at the pharmaseutical company, Bausch + Lomb, working in their IT department, and I have gotten to work with many different projects and technologies along the way!</p>
        <p> In my first summer at my internship, I worked on a tenet-to-tenet cloud migration using Microsoft Azure. Much of my work was done on the backend, using Microsoft Endpoint Manager to interact with devices and applications on the backend
        </p>
        <p> During my second summer, I returned to the same company to focus on different aspects of corporate IT. Much of my work revolved around IT project management, C-Suite management, data management, and technology troubleshooting. </p>

        <h3> Post-Grad Plans:</h3>
        <p> As my college career comes to an end, I have been exploring careers in technology and cybersecurity consulting. In early September, I attended the Technology Mixer hosted by the Broad College of Business and met with many great employers. Last month, I announced that I would join Terillium as a Staff Consultant in their development branch in Cincinnati. I am excited about this opportunity and seeing how my career grows here! </p>
