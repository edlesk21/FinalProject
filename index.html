        <p>     Hi! My name is Edward Leskauskas (but I go by E.J.) and I am currently at Senior at Michigan State University. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Science, with a focus in Human-Centered Technology. </p>
        <p> Originally from New Jersey, I chose to come to MSU to expand my horizons and explore what Michigan had to offer. Coming to college, I planned on studying Political Science and go to law school, but I found that I had a passion for technology. My sophomore year I changed my major to Computer Science, where I learned that programming was something that really enjoyed doing.
