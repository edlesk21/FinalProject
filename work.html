            <h3> Presentation: Vulnerabilities within API's</h3>
            <p> A research-driven honors presentation about API interactions in our world and how they play a significant role in cyber security. Leaky APIs are the cause of many cyber attacks and some which you may have even been a part of. In this presentation, I discussed three different case studies on companies with cybersecurity issues within API's. Ending the presentation, I discuss how issues like leaky APIs can be remediated or monitored and other methods to improve security.</p>
            <h3> Research Paper: The Effects of Cyberseurity in Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>  Research paper on the importance of security in different levels of cloud computing. Discussing SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), and PaaS (Platforms-as-a-Service), the overall implications on each level change, but they are essential to watch over.  </p>
            <h3> Interactive Prototype: Video Game Kiosk</h3>
            <p> This group project revolved around prototyping a new technology to solve a real-world problem. Our group decided to create a video game database (or kiosk) that allows users to access any video game worldwide by scanning the barcode or searching for the code. We used Figma as our leading technology for making our wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes during our process.</p>
            <h3> Programming: Industry-Style Programming</h3>
            <p>  For this honors project, my assignment was to write a program to a student's specifications. The Python program written was a game of checkers that allowed players to choose the size of the playable board (up to 10 x 10) and play a complete game of checkers. The project's main focus was function writing, dictionaries, and lists.</p>
