            <h3> Vulnerabilities within API's</h3>
            <p> A research-driven presentation about API interactions in our world and how they play a significant role in cyber security. Leaky APIs are the cause of many cyber attacks and some which you may have even been a part of. In this presentation, I discussed three different case studies on companies with cybersecurity issues within API's. Ending the presentation, I discuss how issues like leaky APIs can be remediated or monitored and other methods to improve security.</p>
            <h3> The Effects of Cyberseurity in Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>  Research paper on the importance of security in different levels of cloud computing. Discussing SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), and PaaS (Platforms-as-a-Service), the overall implications on each level change, but they are essential to watch over.  </p>
            <h3> Interactive Prototype: Video Game Kiosk</h3>
            <p> This group project revolved around the process of prototyping a new technology to solve a real-world problem. Our group decided to create a video game database (or kiosk) that allows users to simply access any video game in the world, either by scanning the barcode or searching for the code. During our process, we used Figma as out main technology for making our wireframes, as well as high-fidelity prototypes.</p>
